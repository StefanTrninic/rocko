  <h5>RULES</h5>
  <p>
    BASIC TOURNAMENT RULES Goalkeepers will always be controlled by AI. The
    teams will be formed by the number of players that each captain considers
    appropriate. In each match it will be possible to play with a maximum of 10
    players and will be obligatory to play with a minimum of 8 players to start
    an official match. If one team have less than 8 players, game will not be
    accepted, unless the other captain agree to play against that team. The
    agreement should be sent to PES FM admin team before the game. SCHEDULE
    Schedule for both divisions is available on PESFM.org website – 1 round = 1
    week. Every sunday night the Admins will do a report about last week. Game

    and reasons for doing it. If one team is late more than 14 days, the other
    captain can require 6 points from that game. CONTROLS
